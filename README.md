# 🌲 Forest Cover Type Prediction: A Machine Learning Project 🌲

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting **forest cover types** using the [UCI Covertype dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/31/covertype).
The dataset contains **581,012 samples** and **54 features**, representing cartographic and environmental attributes.
The task is a **multi-class classification problem** involving **7 forest cover types**.

The model achieved an impressive **94.1% accuracy**, improving significantly from a baseline of 73%.

## 📊 The Challenge
Predicting forest cover types is crucial for:
- **Forest management**
- **Conservation planning**
- **Wildfire risk assessment**
- **Ecological monitoring**

## 🚀 Approach
1. **Data Optimization**
   - Handled severe class imbalance
   - Removed low-variance features

2. **Advanced Modeling**
   - Implemented **Random Forest**, **Gradient Boosting**, and **ensemble methods**

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Applied **GridSearchCV** for optimization

4. **Feature Engineering**
   - Created new meaningful features to boost accuracy

## 🎯 Key Results
- ✅ Improved accuracy from **73% → 94.1%** (+21.1% improvement)
- ✅ Identified **Elevation** as the most predictive feature (24.3% importance)
- ✅ Ensemble model outperformed individual algorithms
- ✅ Revealed which forest types are hardest to classify

## 💡 Business Impact
This model enables forestry services to:
